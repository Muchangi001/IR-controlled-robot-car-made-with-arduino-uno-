A robotic car that is controlled using IR signals from a tv remote
Components used:
     1.Arduino uno board
     2.Motor driver(L298N)->for controlling the speed and direction of the gear (DC) motors
     3.Two gear motors attached to the chassis
     4.Two wheels for each gear motor and 1 extra for maneuvering
     5.12V battery->to power the arduino uno
     6.6V battery ->to power the motor driver
     7.An infra red receiver->for capturing IR signals
     8.A TV remote ->for sending IR signals to control the car
